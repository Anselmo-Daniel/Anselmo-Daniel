### ‚ö° Research and undergraduate work

#### CIR Model and Bond Pricing

- Simulating bond prices using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, a popular framework for modeling interest rates.
- Explored the relationship between stochastic interest rates and their effects on bond prices, leveraging numerical methods for simulation and analysis.
- Development of a statistical method for calibration based on interest rate market data for the parameters of the circular model

#### COPOM Rate Modeling

- Based on the study "Pricing Interest Rate Derivatives Under Monetary Changes" by Alan De Genaro and Marco Avellaneda, which provided foundational methodologies and insights for modeling interest rate dynamics.
- Designed a probabilistic model to evaluate monetary policy decisions made by the Central Bank of Brazil's Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM).
- Focused on state transition probabilities to assess how interest rates change before and after committee meetings.
- Incorporated financial data and macroeconomic indicators to predict potential rate adjustments, providing insights into market expectations.
- Applied optimization techniques to improve the accuracy of predictions and model calibration.
