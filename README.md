# üëã Hi there, I'm Daniel

## About Me

I'm a passionate and driven Applied Mathematics undergraduate student at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), specializing in mathematical modeling, probability, and scientific computing. My main goal is to apply my analytical skills to solve real-world problems in the financial market.

## Academic Background

- **Scientific Computing:** Focused on algorithms and numerical methods.
- **Statistics:** Including inferential statistics and hypothesis testing.
- **Probability Theory:** Providing the foundation for stochastic modeling and risk analysis.
- **Regression and Classification Models:** Applied to predictive modeling and machine learning.
- **Financial Modeling:** Developed skills in applying stochastic differential equations.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Studied methods for solving mathematical optimization problems, applicable to financial decision-making and portfolio optimization.
- **Fundamentals of Neural Networks/Deep Learning:** Basic understanding of deep learning and its applications in data analysis.
- **Pure Mathematics:** Strong foundation in Analysis and Linear Algebra, essential for advanced mathematical modeling.

### ‚ö° Research and Undergraduate Projects

#### CIR Model and Bond Pricing

- Simulated bond prices using the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model, a common framework for modeling interest rates.
- Explored the relationship between stochastic interest rates and their impact on bond prices, using numerical methods for simulation and analysis.
- Developed a statistical calibration method based on interest rate market data for the parameters of the CIR model.

#### COPOM Rate Modeling

- Based on the study "Pricing Interest Rate Derivatives Under Monetary Changes" by Alan De Genaro and Marco Avellaneda, which provided foundational methodologies and insights into interest rate dynamics.
- Designed a probabilistic model to evaluate monetary policy decisions made by the Central Bank of Brazil's Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM).
- Analyzed state transition probabilities to assess how interest rates change before and after committee meetings.
- Incorporated financial data and macroeconomic indicators to predict potential rate adjustments and provide insights into market expectations.
- Applied optimization techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and model calibration.
